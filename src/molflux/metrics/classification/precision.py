_DESCRIPTION = """
Compute the precision score.
The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample
that is negative.
The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0.

Args:
    predictions: Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.
    references: Ground truth (correct) target values.
    average (optional): {'micro', 'macro', 'samples','weighted', 'binary'} or
        None, default='binary'. This parameter is required for
        multiclass/multilabel targets. If ``None``, the scores for each class
        are returned. Otherwise, this determines the type of averaging performed
        on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).
    labels (optional): The set of labels to include when
        ``average != 'binary'``, and their order if ``average is None``.
        Labels present in the data can be excluded, for example to calculate a
        multiclass average ignoring a majority negative class, while labels not
        present in the data will result in 0 components in a macro average.
        For multilabel targets, labels are column indices. By default, all
        labels in ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.
    pos_label (optional): The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the
        data is binary. If the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be
        ignored; setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'``
        will report scores for that label only. Defaults to 1.
    sample_weight (optional): Weighting of each sample.
    zero_division (optional): "warn", 0 or 1. Sets the value to return when
        there is a zero division, i.e. when all predictions and labels are
        negative. If set to "warn", this acts as 0, but warnings are also
        raised. Defaults to "warn".

Returns:
    precision: Precision of the positive class in binary classification or
    weighted average of the precision of each class for the multiclass task.

Examples:
    >>> from molflux.metrics import load_metric
    >>> metric = load_metric("precision")
    >>> references = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
    >>> predictions = [0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1]
    >>> metric.compute(references=references, predictions=predictions, average="macro")
    {'precision': 0.22...}
    >>> metric.compute(references=references, predictions=predictions, average="micro")
    {'precision': 0.33...}
    >>> metric.compute(references=references, predictions=predictions, average="weighted")
    {'precision': 0.22...}
    >>> metric.compute(references=references, predictions=predictions, average=None)
    {'precision': [0.66..., 0.0, 0.0]}
    >>> predictions = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    >>> metric.compute(references=references, predictions=predictions, average=None)
    {'precision': [0.33..., 0.0, 0.0]}
    >>> metric.compute(references=references, predictions=predictions, average=None, zero_division=1)
    {'precision': [0.33..., 1.0, 1.0]}

Notes:
    When ``true positive + false positive == 0``, precision returns 0 and
    raises ``UndefinedMetricWarning``. This behavior can be
    modified with ``zero_division``.
