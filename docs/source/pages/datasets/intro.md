# Datasets in a nutshell

{sub-ref}`wordcount-words` words | {sub-ref}`wordcount-minutes` min read

The cornerstone of machine learning is data. Datasets for drug discovery in particular are numerous and rapidly evolving.
New datasets are constantly being created but accessing them from different sources quickly becomes tedious, inconvenient,
and prone to incompatibilities.

The ``datasets`` submodule is meant to address all of these issues. It is a library of many different datasets from
multiple sources. Whether you are looking for public datasets (such as PDBBind or QM9) or just easy access to saved data,
``datasets`` provides a standard and modular interface for accessing and manipulating these datasets!

It is built on top of huggingface ``datasets``. (LINK)
